# AtomicHorse Modules for VCV Rack
Version: 1.0.0

Some C++ self-learning and fun time with some math. Do some design stuff. And maybe use it in future for music making with VCV Rack.

I use some free fonts from [FontSpace](https://www.fontspace.com/commercial-fonts):

## VCO-1

First take of VCO. I want some extra things in VCO, but can't find it on other. That's why I start this. I know that's all can be done with VCV Fundament collection of modules. But I want some narrowed panel for eye-pick look.

> It is working, but have some issues with polyphony. Only 4 voices is functioning right for now.

## Envelope-1

First take of Envelope. Enhanced version of typical ADSR with start time, hold time and delay time. And I want emplement some slope controls of attack, decay and release.

> Not working for now. Only skeleton for visual design experiments.
