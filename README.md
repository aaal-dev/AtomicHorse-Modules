# AtomicHorse Modules for VCV Rack
Version: 1.0.0-test

Some C++ self-learning and fun time with some math. Do some design stuff. And maybe use it in future for music making with VCV Rack.

I use some free fonts from [FontSpace](https://www.fontspace.com/commercial-fonts):

First take of VCO. I want some extra things in VCO, but can't find it on other. That's why I start this. I know that's all can be done with VCV Fundament collection of modules. But I want some narrowed panel for eye-pick look.
